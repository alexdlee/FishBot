# FishBot

Project description: Welcome to the FishBot application. This is an iOS application that serves as a fishing assistant, helping to eliminate the variability of fishing success by utilizing user data. Have you ever spent countless hours without a single bite? These are the types of problems that my application is aimed at solving. Users may enter fishing data from their past fishing sessions to refer to in the future, and the program will also automatically provide fishing suggestions based directly upon user's past data.

Main features: One key component of the program is its ability to provide a suggestion about the length of equipment the user should use based on the known number of obstacles in a body of water, as well as the anticipated length of the fishing session. Additionally, users can record notes specific to fishing locations, record and track the amount of bait they have remaining, and also record the length of a caught fish and the time elapsed to catch it.

Future modifications: In the future, I would like to clean up the UI of the application to better convey what each button does. In order to provide more accurate and useful suggestions to the user, machine learning techniques could be implemented on the user's stored data.

How to Run FishBot: In Github, click the green "Code" button on the home page of the FishBot repository. Copy the url used to clone the FishBot project. Next, open XCode and choose the "Clone Git Repository" option and paste the url.
